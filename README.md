# How to run the code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This was simply used to get quickly started with React. Typically I prefer using a webpack/babel implementation for easy legacy support, but as this was my first time using SCSS (I've used LESS in the past) I wanted to keep things as simple as possible.

Before running the scripts below to test, be sure to run the `npm install` command to populate the node_modules.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
